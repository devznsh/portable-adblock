# Laptop-Based Pi-hole + Tailscale Ad Blocking (Windows)

A simple, Raspberry Pi–free setup to block ads across devices using **Pi-hole in Docker** on a Windows laptop and **Tailscale** for secure DNS routing. This gives network‑wide ad blocking at home *and* on the go.

> Tested on **iPhone** via Tailscale — ads were blocked successfully.

---

## ✨ What This Does

- Runs **Pi-hole** in Docker on a Windows laptop
- Uses **Tailscale** to route DNS from devices anywhere
- Blocks ads on **iPhone** and other devices when connected

---

##  Requirements

- Windows laptop (always on when you want ad blocking)
- Docker Desktop (with WSL2)
- Tailscale (Windows + iPhone)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Steps

### 1) Install Docker + Tailscale
- Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop  
- Tailscale (Windows): https://tailscale.com/download/windows  
- Tailscale (iPhone): App Store

---

### 2) Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    hostname: pihole
    environment:
      TZ: "Asia/Kolkata"
      WEBPASSWORD: "your-password"
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
    volumes:
      - "./etc-pihole:/etc/pihole"
      - "./etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

---

### 3) Start Pi-hole

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

---

### 4) Open Pi-hole Admin

```
http://localhost/admin
```

Login using the password from `WEBPASSWORD`.

---

### 5) Allow Tailscale traffic in Pi-hole
**Settings → DNS → Interface settings →** 

✅ **Permit all origins**

---

### 6) Configure Tailscale DNS
1. Open Tailscale on Windows and copy your **Tailscale IP** (`100.x.x.x`).
2. Go to **Tailscale Admin Console → DNS**  
   - Add **Custom nameserver** = your laptop’s Tailscale IP  
   - Turn **Override local DNS** ON

---

### 7) Connect iPhone
- Install Tailscale on iPhone  
- Turn it ON  
- Ads are now blocked via Pi-hole

---

##  Testing

- https://testads.org  
- https://speedtest.net (usually shows ads)

---

##  Notes

- Your laptop must be **ON** for ad blocking to work.
- You can reset Pi-hole password if needed:
  ```powershell
  docker exec -it pihole pihole setpassword
  ```
